Application for *Hack like a Girl* at Nike WHQ, Feb 2015


# REACH

REACH is a web application designed as a portal to help women who want to improve their tech skills find mentors and other women with similar interests. Members can create online profiles, view profiles of other members and contact members to iniatiate a professional and/or mentoring connection. 

The app will use existing APIs to make it easier for users to access resources, make personal connections and serve as a "one stop shop" for helping women in tech build their careers.
