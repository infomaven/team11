We can delete this file once people have seen it.  I figured out what you meant about the wiki, Nadine...the little book icon on the right side of the page!  I added some git hub stuff to it, but want to leave this file here for now so I can try it as a pull request for adding in something I've done on a different branch.  My impression is that the wiki is there regardless of what branch we are on at the time.
